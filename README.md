The difference between classes and cars is that objects can be multiple parts relating to a class. For example,
you could create a book class. With this class, a book can be broken down into sub-categories called objects. 
These objects would be used to give more detail or information pertaining to the class. 
You could make objects for the title, author, genre, and even pages. 
All of these objects represent, as a whole, what is being described (the class).
